                <Label Text="The Porsche 924 Carrera GTP was driven by 3 teams: Germany 924 GTP 001, Great Britain 924 GTP 002 and The United States 924 GTP 003. They first entered Le Mans in 1980 with high hopes as Porsche had dominated the 70's with a record number of Le Mans and the 80's saw the agenda change and more of a challenge and so entered the 924's in the prototype class hence the name 924 GTP. The 924 GTPs finished in 6th (924 GTP 001), 12th (924 GTP 002) and 13th (924 GTP 003) even though this was not the like the Porsches in the 70s but they had beaten the expectations of the 924 prior to entering and just finishing Le Mans is a massive engineering achiement in its self so placing 6th, 12th and 13th was not only respectable, but a testament to the 924 GTP's abilities and that of its drivers and team behind it. The 924 GTP was retired in 1982, 2 years after first competeing in Le Mans, with a respectable record that showed the capablities of the 924 Carrera GTP.
