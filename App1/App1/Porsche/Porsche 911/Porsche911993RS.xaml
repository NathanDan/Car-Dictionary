                <Label Text="The Porsche 911 993 RS marked the last air-cooled era for the Porsche RS line-up, the 993 RS rolled off the production line in 1995 and only ran for one year. It was the standard Porsche 993 on steroids, it was lighter than the standard version, it produced 28 BHP more than the standard one and it recived one of its most iconic features... The 993 RS Bodykit that made the overall car 2.4 inches wider and the iconic rear wing that is renowned with the recent RS models. It truly was a street legal race car with it's six-point harness and welded in roll cage and light weight racing seats, this was a car built for the road but had race pedigree running through it's heart!
