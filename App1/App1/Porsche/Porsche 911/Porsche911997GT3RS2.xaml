                <Label Text="The Porsche 911 997 GT3 RS (Gen 2) was first shown to the world in 2009, 3 years later than the previous Gen 1 model and over theose 3 years the porsche engineers had managed to squeeze more out of the 997. They fitted a larger 3.8 litre engine compared to the 3.6 litre engine that was in the Gen 1, by doing so they had upped the HP from 415 to 450 and reduced the 0-62 to a mere 4 seconds, it truly was a street legal race car. Apart from this most of the changes done were cosmetic, with The change coming to the back end of the 997 - This included the tail lights and the new rear wing struts that were now holo rather than solid like in the Gen 1.
