                <Label Text="The Porsche 911 997 GT3 RS (Gen 1) was first introduced to the world in 2006 and quickly showed the world what the RS name meant, with its new adjustable carbon wing to it's lightweight plastic composite windscreen this allowed people to have a higher power to weight ratio which was around 300 HP per tonne! This model also saw it take off in a range of racing series across both Europe and America, although these were slightly more reduced in weight (Lack of seats!) the road version was practically identical and allowed people to have a true race car as a street legal car to drive and it was later updated with the Gen 2 a few years later.
