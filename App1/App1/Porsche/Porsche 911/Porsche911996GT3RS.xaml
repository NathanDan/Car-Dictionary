                <Label Text="The Porsche 911 996 GT3 RS came off the production line in 2003 it was a symbol of a modern performance car with all of the luxuries of a premium sports car, along with all of the technological advancements of era that the GT3 RS came from. Like the other RS models they ultimatley stem from the base 911 and then make them a pure street legal race car. Although some luxury features added weight the main goal was still weight reduction, and this can be found all over the car, from the whole bodyshell only weighing 14KG to a saving of 8KG from the bonnet as it was now a fully carbon bonnet. This paired with Porsche's new water cooled engine that gave the 996 GT3 RS her bite and raw race pedigree.
